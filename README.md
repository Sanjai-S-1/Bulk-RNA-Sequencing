# Transcriptome Analysis of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells in Pulmonary Sarcoidosis

## Overview

The primary goal of this project is to meticulously replicate the results presented in the paper titled "Transcriptome Analysis of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells in Pulmonary Sarcoidosis," originally published in Frontiers in Medicine. This involves conducting a thorough transcriptome analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to validate the reported findings.
